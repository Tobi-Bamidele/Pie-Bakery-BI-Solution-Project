# Pie-Bakery-BI-Solution-Project


### Project Overview

The data for this project was downloaded from the Onyx data challenge website. We then proceed to import the data into Power BI to carry out the necessary analysis.
The aim of this project is to help Pie Bakery to improve their business by gathering insights from the last two years of pie sales!

#### Tools
- Microsoft Power BI - Data cleaning, Data transformation, Data Modelling and Data Visualization

#### Data cleaning/ Data Transformation
- Load in data
- Transformed data in the power query editor
- Add calendar table
- Carried out Normalization
- Removed unwanted columns
- Added conditional columns

#### DAX 
After data cleaning, data transformation, and data modeling, we proceeded to write the following DAX to create the measures we will be using in creating the dashboard report. Before creating the dashboard, we ensure to filter the data to the last two years as required

- First Transaction Date
- Total Revenue
- Revenue 2020
- Revenue 2021
- Average Revenue
- Current Date
- Number of Transactions
- Organic Pie revenue
- Inorganic Pie Revenue
- Revenue from sales of whole pies
- Revenue from sales of sliced pies
- In-store sales revenue
- Pre-order sales revenue
- Cumulative revenue

#### Key Observations
- Customers prefer to buy whole pies rather than slices
- From the dashboard above, customers prefer organic to non-organic
- More sales were generated from pre-ordering compared to in-store sales signifying that customers kind of prefer pre-ordering compared to buying from the store.

#### Recommendations
- For pie flavors, each flavor should be produced more when the fruits are in their seasons to drive in more sales
- Looking at the monthly trend of sales, sales declined from April. Diagnostic analysis should be carried out on that.

Lastly, we also carried out diagnostic analysis into why he had massive increases or decreases in sales for some time periods.
